# Cluster Server RV2768 Brief

**[PDF Version](https://cdn-resource.spacemit.com/file/product/K3/k3-rv2768_brief_en.pdf)**

**768-Core Native RISC-V AI Compute Cluster**

The Cluster Server RV2768 is a RISC-V-based cluster server in a 2U, 19-inch rack form factor, integrating up to 48 SpacemiT K3 processors and compliant with the RVA23 profile defined by RISC-V International.

RVA23 targets general-purpose application processors, requiring support for Vector and Hypervisor extensions, and represents a modern performance standard for AI and high-performance workloads. The system delivers 768 native RISC-V cores, making it well-suited for running large numbers of AI agents and applications while handling compute-intensive data processing tasks.

With a multi-node cluster architecture and full hardware virtualization, the server allows multiple users to run independent computing environments simultaneously without interference, providing hardware-level isolation between users. Leveraging vector extensions, it delivers up to 2880 TOPS of AI compute and supports up to 1536 GB of memory, enabling concurrent AI inference workloads.

## Key Features

- **Reliable & Serviceable**
  - Independent maintenance, remote access, debugging, and upgrade per compute node
  - Front I/O design for simplified servicing and improved thermal efficiency (no rear cabling)
  - Rear “N+1” redundant fan design
- **Flexible Compute Scaling**
  - 2U chassis supporting up to 48 compute nodes (384 CPU cores + 384 AI cores)
  - External switch connectivity to any node via independent, non-blocking channels
- **Intelligent Management**
  - PXE boot support for diskless startup via network
  - Integrated Layer 3 management switch supporting VLAN segmentation, dynamic routing, and link aggregation
  - Built-in BMC for system monitoring, thermal control, and compute module management
- **Standards-Compliant Architecture**
  - RVA23 profile support, meeting instruction set requirements for high-end Linux distributions over the next five years and beyond
  - Full hardware virtualization across CPU, memory, interrupts, and I/O
  - 1024-bit wide parallel AI compute for efficient integration with mainstream AI ecosystems
