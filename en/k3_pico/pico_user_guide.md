## 1. Quick Start

Welcome to the SpacemiT K3 Pico-ITX single-board computer user guide.

The K3 Pico-ITX is available in two package options:

- **Single Board Kit**
  ![](./static/pico_base.png)

- **Chassis Kit**
  ![](./static/pico_case.png)

Before getting started, connect the following required peripherals. Once power is connected, you can power on the board and begin using it:

- A Type-C power adapter or ATX 2-Pin DC power supply (a 20 V / 5 A power adapter is recommended)
  > Note:  
  > - The Type-C power adapter must provide a rated output of at least 20V @ 3.25A;  
  > - The ATX 2-pin DC power supply must provide a rated output of at least 12V @ 5A.
- A monitor
- A keyboard
- A mouse

You can power the K3 Pico-ITX and connect a display in either of the following ways:

**Method 1**: Use a monitor that supports 65 W or higher USB Type-C power delivery, and connect the monitor to the board with a full-featured Type-C cable.

- **Method 1 (Single Board Kit)**
  ![](./static/pico_base_01.png)

- **Method 1 (Chassis Kit)**
  ![](./static/pico_case_01.png)

**Method 2**: Use a multifunction dock that supports HDMI output, USB, and PD charging. Connect the dock to the board’s full-featured Type-C port to carry both power and display signals.

- **Method 2 (Single Board Kit)**

### 2.3 Interface Description

#### 2.3.1 Power Input

- USB Type-C supports USB PD 3.0 power delivery, up to 20 V / 5 A

- ATX power input supports up to **12 V / 7 A**. When an ATX power supply is connected, the system will prioritize ATX power.

  > **Note:** ATX and Type-C PD power do not support 1+1 hot redundancy.
  > - When the system is powered by ATX, it will continue to use ATX power even if a PD-capable Type-C cable is connected.
  > - To switch to Type-C PD power, shut down the system, disconnect the ATX power supply, and then power on.
  > - If the ATX power supply is removed while the system is running with Type-C PD power, the system will restart and automatically switch to Type-C PD power.
  > - If an ATX power supply is connected while the system is running on Type-C PD power, the system will restart and switch to ATX power.

- In flashing mode, the full-featured Type-C port supports both power input and USB Device functionality. When connected to a host PC via USB Type-C, the board is recognized by the host and can be used for flashing and firmware updates.

### 3.2 Serial Debugging

#### 3.2.1 Interface Connection

Use a **USB-to-TTL** adapter to connect the host PC to the K3 Pico-ITX board header through **TX**, **RX**, and **GND**, as shown below.

Here, Tx and Rx represent the transmit and receive signals of the K3 board, respectively.

![](./static/signal00.png)  

#### 3.2.2 Debugging on Windows (Using MobaXterm as an Example)

The following steps use MobaXterm as an example.

First, connect the serial hardware correctly, and confirm in Windows Device Manager under **Ports** that the corresponding COM port has been recognized, as shown below.
![Windows Device Manager serial port example](./static/port.png)

1. Open MobaXterm, then select **Sessions → New Session**.

   ![Example of creating a new serial session in MobaXterm](./static/mobaxterm.png)

2. In the dialog box, select **Serial**.

3. In the **Serial port** drop-down list, select the detected COM port.

4. Set **Speed** to **115200**.

5. Click **OK** to enter the serial log output page.

## 4. Precautions

The K3 Pico-ITX is suitable for home, office, and industrial environments. Before operating the board, read the following precautions carefully:

1. Do not hot-plug display interfaces, CSI interfaces, or expansion boards under any circumstances.
2. Before unpacking or installing the single-board computer, take proper anti-static precautions to avoid ESD damage to the hardware.
3. When handling the board, hold it by the edges. Do not touch exposed metal parts on the board, to avoid electrostatic damage to components.
4. Place the board on a dry, flat surface, away from heat sources, electromagnetic interference sources, radiation sources, and devices sensitive to electromagnetic radiation, such as medical equipment.
5. Keep the board in a well-ventilated environment. If the system must run continuously at full load for 72 hours or longer, install the original heatsink or implement sufficient cooling measures.
