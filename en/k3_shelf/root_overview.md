# K3 Shelf Array Server Brief

**[PDF Version](https://cdn-resource.spacemit.com/file/product/K3/k3-shelf_brief_en.pdf)**

**K3 Shelf Native RISC-V Build Cluster Server**

SpacemiT K3 Shelf is available in two high-density rack server models, N10 and N48, powered by the self-developed K3 AI CPU based on the RVA23 Profile. Each compute node features an 8-core X100 RISC-V CPU running at up to 2.4 GHz, delivering up to 60 TOPS of AI performance.

Built on a native RISC-V architecture, K3 Shelf supports mainstream build systems such as Koji and Open Build Service (OBS). Native compilation delivers over 10× the performance of QEMU emulation on x86, significantly reducing build times for operating systems, firmware, and open-source software.

With a typical power consumption of just 15–25 W per node, K3 Shelf reduces power usage by up to 60% compared with conventional x86 servers. Equipped with four 10GbE ports, a full BMC management system, remote serial console, and cloud debugging, it is an ideal platform for RISC-V software validation, distributed source code builds, on-premises LLM deployment, and edge computing.

## Key Features

- **10/48 K3 compute nodes**

  Each K3 node features an 8-core X100 RISC-V CPU at up to 2.4 GHz and an 8-core A100 AI CPU, delivering up to 60 TOPS.

- **Mainstream Linux Build System Support**
  
  Supports Koji and Open Build Service (OBS), with native compilation over 10× faster than QEMU on x86.

- **RISC-V Software Compatibility Testing**
  
  The industry's first mass-produced RVA23 Profile array server for validating Linux distributions, open-source software, and AI frameworks.

- **Remote RISC-V Cloud Debugging**

  Supports remote flashing, serial console, SSH, Web IDE, and remote desktop for an out-of-the-box cloud development environment.

- **Exceptional Energy Efficiency**

  Twelve K3 nodes match the build performance of a mid-range x86 workstation while consuming just 15–25 W per node, cutting power costs by up to 60%.

- **Equipped with 4 × 10GbE ports**

  Features 4×10GbE (SFP+) ports and a dedicated MGMT port for high-speed networking and BMC management.

- **Integrated BMC Management**

  Provides real-time monitoring, configuration, hardware management, diagnostics, firmware updates, and open APIs for software development.

- **Broad Application Scenarios**

  Ideal for AI computing, edge AI, on-premises LLM deployment, smart cities, healthcare, industrial AI, and intelligent security.
