You can connect a wired keyboard, mouse, or USB receiver to any USB-A port on the K3 CoM260 Development Kit. Bluetooth keyboards and mice are also supported.

#### 6.1.3 Display

K3 CoM260 requires an external display for video output. The product supports both DP and MIPI DSI video interfaces, so either one display or both types of displays can be connected.

> **Note**: If video output is required through the MIPI DSI interface, make sure the display and K3 CoM260 are connected before power-on. The MIPI DSI interface on K3 CoM260 **does not support hot plugging**.

#### 6.1.4 Network Connection

K3 CoM260 supports wired RJ45 network connections and can be connected directly to an Ethernet cable.  
It also supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth wireless connections. An external antenna can be installed for stronger signal reception.

### 6.2 Power-On

Complete the following connections before powering on the device:

- Connect the device to a display using a video cable, and connect the keyboard and mouse.
- Last, connect the power cable and power on the device.
  - On first power-up: the device powers on automatically.
  - After software shutdown: press the power button briefly to power on again.

After startup:

- The red power indicator on the K3 CoM260 Development Kit lights up.
- The cooling fan on the K3 CoM260 module starts moving.

### 6.3 Configure K3-CoM260 on First Boot

K3 CoM260 comes preinstalled with the Bianbu operating system. A setup wizard runs automatically on first boot, and a display, keyboard, and mouse are required to complete the configuration.

For detailed configuration instructions, refer to [LXQt Startup Wizard (Initial Setup)](https://spacemit.com/community/document/info?lang=en&nodepath=software/SDK/bianbu/user_guide/LXQt/initial_setup_and_sessions.md).

## 7. Firmware Flashing

Before entering flashing mode, prepare two push buttons: one for shorting FC_REC to GND, and the other for shorting SYS_RST to GND.

1. **When the device is powered off**
   1. Press and hold the FC_REC button.
   2. Connect the power adapter to power on the device.
   3. Release the FC_REC button.
   4. Use a Type-C data cable to connect the Type-C port on the development board to the host computer.
   5. Use the SpacemiT Titan flashing tool or run the `fastboot` command to flash the firmware.
2. **When the device is already powered on and running**
   1. Press and hold the FC_REC button.
   2. Briefly press the RST button.
   3. Release the FC_REC button.
   4. Use a Type-C data cable to connect the Type-C port on the development board to the host computer.
   5. Use the SpacemiT Titan flashing tool or run the `fastboot` command to flash the firmware.

![Button connection diagram for entering flashing mode](./static/Input_keys.png)

For the flashing procedure, refer to the [Flashing Tool User Guide](https://www.spacemit.com/community/document/info?lang=en&nodepath=tools/user_guide/flasher_user_guide.md).

### 7.2 Firmware Download and Installation

![Serial interface connection diagram](./static/Input_keys.png)

### 8.2 Debugging on Windows

MobaXterm is used as exmple below:

First, connect the serial hardware correctly, and then confirm under **Ports** in Windows Device Manager that the corresponding COM port can be recognized, as shown below.

![Windows Device Manager COM port recognition](./static/port.png)

1. Open MobaXterm, then select **Sessions → New Session**.  

   ![MobaXterm new serial session](./static/mobaxterm.png)

2. In the dialog box that appears, select **Serial**.  
3. In the **Serial port** drop-down list, select the recognized COM port.  
4. Set **Speed** to **115200**.  
5. Click **OK** to enter the serial log output page.

## 9. Precautions

K3 CoM260 is intended for laboratory or engineering environments. Before use, read the following precautions carefully:

1. Do not hot-plug the display interface, CSI interface, or expansion board under any circumstances.  
2. Before unpacking and installation, take necessary anti-static precautions to avoid damage to the development board caused by electrostatic discharge (ESD).  
3. When handling the development board, hold the board edges and avoid touching exposed metal parts to prevent ESD damage to components.  
4. Place the development board on a dry, flat surface, and keep it away from heat sources, electromagnetic interference sources, radiation sources, and electromagnetically sensitive equipment such as medical devices.
