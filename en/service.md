# Support & Service

## After-Sales Notes

- Before purchasing any product in the MUSE ecosystem, please carefully review the product specifications. MUSE ecosystem products are development-class devices and may not meet all requirements related to specific functions, use cases, or system/software compatibility. These products are not eligible for the “7-day no-reason return” service. Free warranty service is provided only for hardware defects covered within the warranty period.
- After purchase, please keep all related proof of purchase and invoices for future maintenance and service needs.
- Each product includes a limited free warranty starting from the date of purchase. For specific warranty durations, refer to the product’s warranty documentation or the information published on the official website.
- During the warranty period, if the product experiences a non-man-made hardware failure, the user must provide a written description of the issue, and send the warranty card and proof of purchase to the designated address (consult the seller for details). After the seller confirms that the issue is a product quality defect and meets warranty conditions, the return shipping cost will be covered by the seller. If the seller determines the issue is not a product quality defect (e.g., due to flashing unofficial firmware, missing or mismatched EEPROM data, etc.) or does not meet warranty conditions, the return shipping cost will be borne by the buyer.
- For out-of-warranty failures or damages caused by human factors, users may request paid repair services.
- For failures caused by unauthorized disassembly or modification, warranty service will not be provided. Paid repair service is available, and the user must cover all related repair and shipping costs.

## FAQ

### System & Usage

#### Q1: What should I do if I encounter application errors or mouse lag after the first boot?

**A**:
After the initial boot setup, some system configurations may not be fully applied yet. We recommend **restarting the device once**. The system should function normally after the reboot.

#### Q2: How do I reset my password if I forget it?

**A**:

1. Connect the MUSE Book to a host computer (e.g., PC) using a serial cable.
2. Open a serial communication software on the host computer and log in with the administrator account:
    - Username: `root`
    - Password: `bianbu`
3. After logging in, execute one of the following commands based on your needs:
    - If you want to **keep the user's data**:

        ```bash
        userdel username
        ```

    - If you do **not** want to keep the user's data:

        ```bash
        userdel -r username
        ```

    *(Replace `username` with the actual username of the account whose password you forgot.)*
4. Restart the device. You will be able to enter the setup interface again to create a new username and password.
